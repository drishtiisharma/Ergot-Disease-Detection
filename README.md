# Ergot-Disease-Detection-In-Pearl-Millet

<b>Ergot</b> is a fungal disease that infects pearl millet flowers. It shows up early as a sticky liquid called *honeydew*, but farmers often miss it. If not treated early, it replaces grains with toxic black structures.

This project uses machine learning to detect ergot in the early honeydew stage by analyzing images of infected and healthy crops. So, weâ€™ll be training a model using image datasets and use it to help farmers catch the disease early and save their harvest!
